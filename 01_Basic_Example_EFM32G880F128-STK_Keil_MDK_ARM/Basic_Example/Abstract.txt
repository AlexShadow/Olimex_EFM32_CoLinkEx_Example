I made this example based on Keil MDK-ARM Blinky Example:
C:\Keil\ARM\Boards\EnergyMicro\EFM32_Gxxx_STK\Blinky

The 'Blinky' project is a simple example for Energy Micro
EFM32 Gecko Series using Olimex EFM32G880F128-STK Board and Olimex ARM-JTAG-Coocox

Example functionality:                                                   


 - delay and nop, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode



The Blinky program is available for:

  EFM32G880F128-STK CoLinkEx:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip with CoLinkEx
  
CoLinkEx:

You have to install the CoLinkEx USB Driver and The Keil MDK-ARM Plugin, restart MDK-ARM and then this Project should work.
