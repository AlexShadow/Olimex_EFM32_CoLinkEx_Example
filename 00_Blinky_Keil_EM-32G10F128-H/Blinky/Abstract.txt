I made this example based on Keil MDK-ARM Blinky Example:
C:\Keil\ARM\Boards\EnergyMicro\EFM32_Gxxx_STK\Blinky

The 'Blinky' project is a simple example for Energy Micro
EFM32 Gecko Series using Olimex EM32G210F128H Board and Olimex ARM-JTAG-Coocox

Example functionality:                                                   


 - 1 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode



The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  EFM32G210F128 CoLinkEx:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip with CoLinkEx
                                  
  EFM32G210F128 Ulink2:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip with Keil Ulink2
  
  
CoLinkEx:

You have to install the CoLinkEx USB Driver and The Keil MDK-ARM Plugin, restart MDK-ARM and then this Project should work.
