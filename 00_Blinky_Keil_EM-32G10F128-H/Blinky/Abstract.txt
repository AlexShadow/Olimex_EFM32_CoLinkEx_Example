I made this example based on Keil MDK-ARM Blinky Example:
C:\Keil\ARM\Boards\EnergyMicro\EFM32_Gxxx_STK\Blinky

The 'Blinky' project is a simple example for Energy Micro
EFM32 Gecko Series using Olimex EM32G210F128H Board and Olimex ARM-JTAG-Coocox

Example functionality:                                                   


 - 1 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode



The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  EFM32G210F128 Flash:            runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

CoLinkEx:

You have to install the CoLinkEx USB Driver and The Keil MDK-ARM Plugin, restart MDK-ARM and then this Project should work.

If you like to program this Example with the Olimex ARM-JTAG-Coocox (or another CoLinkEx)
you have to put the following commands into "Options for Targets/User/Run User Program After Build/Run#1"

"fromelf --bin --output .\Flash\Blinky.bin .\Flash\Blinky.axf"

This converts your .axf File into a .bin File before Flash with the CoLinkEx.
